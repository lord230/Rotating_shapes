# Rotating 3D Shapes Visualizer

**An interactive desktop application for visualizing rotating 3D shapes using Python, Tkinter, and NumPy.**
This tool lets you view and control 3D rotation of a torus (donut), cube, or tetrahedron with adjustable speed, size, and axis controls.

## Features

* Real-time rotation of 3D shapes (Donut, Cube, Triangle/Tetrahedron)
* Graphical User Interface with:

  * Shape selection
  * Rotation speed adjustment
  * Size scaling
  * Rotation toggles for X, Y, and Z axes
* Perspective projection for 3D-to-2D visualization
* Help window that explains the underlying concepts

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.7 or later

### Python Packages:

* `tkinter` (usually comes pre-installed)
* `numpy`

To install missing packages automatically, the script will attempt to install them via pip.
